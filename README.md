# CORE - Seismic Analysis

This repositoy contains scripts for developing seismic analysis in OpenSees, following (i) the Linear Static Analysis (Equivalent Static Approach) and (ii) the Time-History Analysis procedure.
It has been created for the course CORE, organised within the MSc Architecture - Building Technology Track - at TU Delft.

The **content** folder contains the following scripts:
- **LinearStaticAnalysis.ipynb**, to implement Linear Static Analayis and Modal Analysis for a Reinforced Concrete frame structure
- **TimeHistoryAnalysis.ipynb**, to implement Time-History Non-Linear Analysis for a Reinforced Concrete frame structure
- **ModalAnalysis.ipynb**, to implement Modal Analysis for a Reinforced Concrete frame structure
